This project is a lofi hip-hop beat maker implemented in Max/MSP. It features a 32-step drum sequencer, a filler instrument channel with predefined chord progressions, and a reverberator based on John Chowningâ€™s model. Users can control the tempo and create custom drum patterns, while various white noise options add a lofi vibe to the background. The reverberator utilizes allpass and comb filters to create a rich sound. Although the project is functional, future improvements could include integrating an Arduino interface for interactive control and enhancing the filler instrument to generate more complex melodies.
