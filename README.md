This project is a lofi hip-hop beat maker DAW (digital audio workstation) built in Max/MSP. It features a 32-step drum sequencer, a filler instrument channel with predefined chord progressions, and a reverberator based on John Chowning's model. Users can control the tempo, create custom drum patterns, and add various white noise for a true lofi vibe. The reverberator uses allpass and comb filters to enhance the sound. While the DAW functions well, there’s room for improvement—like adding an Arduino interface for better control and making the filler instrument more dynamic with complex melodies.
